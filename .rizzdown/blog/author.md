I run a site called pockethost.io. I am a Typescript and nodejs programmer. I'm pretty experienced, but I focus mostly on backend stuff and I know I'm not the best at frontend ui/ux. I have a passion for open source projects and for helping people make their own creations reach people. I have a lot of experience and am seasoned, yet very patient with newcomers. I like to teach. I like to encourage people. I love to learn. I don't trust horses, and I like jiu jitsu.
