The primary audience is software developers, specifically web and nodejs programmers. Lots of interest in cloud services and avoiding writing backends. Many of our users use SvelteKit, React, Vercel, Firebase, and Supabase. My audience does NOT like puffery or flowery language. They like technical inspiration and spending time with tools that will enhance their ability to touch the lives of others with their creations.
