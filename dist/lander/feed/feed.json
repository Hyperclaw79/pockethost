			"content_html": "<p>Hot off the digital press, welcome to the upgraded version of PocketHost, v0.9.2! Like an episode of 'Silicon Valley' meets 'Mr. Robot,' this upgraded experience is reliable, intuitive, and smoother than butter on a hot knife. We've been beavering away behind the scenes, embracing the profound power of <code>rizzdown</code> to AI-enhance our docs and blogs. Just as Neo sees the Matrix, our content is now rizz'd, bringing you clarity amidst complexity, conveniently affixed with community discussion links.</p>\n<p>We've fixed and finessed to enhance your user experience. With bug-bashing efforts on linting errors using prettier, we've added JSON file types to linting, smoothed over registration processes and GitHub Actions, and even added <code>patch-package</code> post-processing to all monorepo packages. Imagine the power of Mjolnir in web development, literally raining down patches in all the right places.</p>\n<p>Our latest dashboard is a work of art, fully supporting a full-screen logging view for instances. It wears a new suit, tailored in the DaisyUI and Tailwind framework, adding a razzle-dazzle element to your working experience. We turned the protective dial up to 'John Wick' levels by introducing IPCIDR filtering – now all traffic must go through the Cloudflare proxy for comprehensive DDos and security coverage.</p>\n<p>The biggest game-changer is the simplified proxy layers from the PocketHost daemon, enhancing reliability to match the highest level of coder zen that comes from less code. With OpenGraph metadata enhancements and a <code>return to top</code> button, we've summoned Avenger-like levels of user-experience power. Try out the new features and immerse yourself in a strengthened, simplified, and slicker PocketHost world.</p>\n<h1 id=\"change-log\" tabindex=\"-1\">Change Log <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.9.2/\">#</a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Version 0.9.2 (patch)</li>\n<li>Fixed Github Actions to properly publish the www static site when commits to the master branch are made</li>\n<li>Started using <code>rizzdown</code> to generate AI-enhanced docs and blog posts.

All hail the <code>pb_hooks</code> directory, a new playground for your wildest Javascript explorations. As a result, Deno worker support took the backstage, but rest assured, it's for a good reason: the stability of the sailing ship that is the PocketHost-PocketBase alliance.</p>\n<p>Expect an extra layer of robustness as instances now run in Docker containers. It's a necessary security guard ensuring every instance holds its ground securely without interfering with the others. Bear with us on this one - we're expecting a little turbulence as we calibrate the Docker influence on the platform.</p>\n<p>Witness the speed of light with Static Site Generation (SSG) on the new-look frontend, now hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It's as if the Mothership running in San Francisco engaged hyperdrive, promising almost instant load times, and delivering a huge upgrade in user experience.</p>\n<p>For an in-depth look at all the enhancements and discussions around v1.0 and its potential paid tiers, hop onto our dedicated Discord server. Your input might just influence the future face of PocketHost. Get your hands on the project now - this ride to fantastic, efficient web hosting is only just beginning.</p>\n<p>PocketHost is the zero-config 'PocketBase in the cloud' platform. Thank you for everyone's continued support for this project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hook-support\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hook Support! <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.9.0/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>PocketHost now officially supports PocketBase JS hooks via the <code>pb_hooks</code> directory. This feature was soft-launched about a month ago and is stable.</p>\n<p>Support for Deno workers has been removed in favor of <code>pb_hooks</code>.</p>\n<p>PocketHost itself also moved some of its own code into <code>pb_hooks</code> with mixed results: database triggers worked well, but API endpoints didn't. We hit too many library and platform incompatibilities with the goja JS runtime environment. The Deno workers allowed full nodejs compatibility, but ultimately, we felt that supporting <code>pb_hooks</code> was going to be better for both the PocketHost and PocketBase projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instances-now-run-in-docker\" tabindex=\"-1\">Instances now run in Docker <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.9.0/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>PocketHost now runs your instance in a Docker container. This helps us guarantee resources for your instance as well as secure your instance from other instances. Now that your PocketBase instance has OS-level access via <code>pb_hooks</code>, this was a necessary security step and is good for stability too.</p>\n<p>We expect <em>some</em> temporary platform instability while we iron out any new side effects introduced by this change, but long term, the PocketHost platform will be more stable and durable with this change in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frontend-is-now-ssg\" tabindex=\"-1\">Frontend is now SSG <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.9.0/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We moved the entire frontend (built in SvelteKit) to SSG on Cloudflare Pages. This means near-instant load times for the PocketHost dashboard anywhere around the globe.</p>\n<p>Piror to this change, the Mothership running in San Francisco USA was running a nodejs web server and serving the frontend. The user experience should be dramatically improved for everyone now.</p>\n<p>This change also gives us the added benefit of CI preview URLs for all frontend updates, even in feature branches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"v1-0-paid-tiers-roadmap-and-discussion\" tabindex=\"-1\">v1.0 Paid Tiers, Roadmap, and Discussion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.9.0/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Many of these updates have surrounded discussion around an eventual v1.0 and introduction of a paid tier.

This iteration, a ‘nuts and bolts’ maintenance release, focuses on ensuring your 0-to-60 transition to a live PocketBase instance—with zero-config—is smoother than ever.</p>\n<p>Delve into the enhanced logging system, designed meticulously for in-depth debugging. Let the FTP enhancements streamline your workflow while the database migration cleanup keeps things tidy in the backend. Pointedly, don't miss the refactored 'Danger Zone' UI— it's designed to keep you safe while still living on the edge.</p>\n<p>Keen eyes might spot a fix for the ‘unzipper’ package failing on node v18.6.0 that was inconspicuously wreaking havoc during PocketBase version upgrades. On the same note, service templates have undergone precise recalibrations, and the <code>node</code> version is now steadfastly locked.</p>\n<p>An array of behind-the-scene chores adds robustness while a refactored UpdaterService compliments these under-the-hood improvements. Look out for changes related to the PocketBase service and SQLite patch updates. There’s also the intro of 'stresser' and 'stresser cleanup' for those who love to push the boundaries.</p>\n<p>The narrative of PocketHost v0.8.2 is written in its changelog.

The &quot;first hit&quot; cost of launching your PocketBase instance from a cold start seems to take &lt;500ms, so it's almost not noticeable under normal application use.</p>\n<p>I also upgraded the server to 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs, so there should be plenty of room to play around.</p>\n<p>At some point down the road, we may accept fly.io machine keys and use fly.io's &quot;machine proxy&quot; service to spin up your instances on-demand. At that point, there won't be shared tenancy anymore.</p>\n<p>But I think shared tenancy does have a place in this space. There is something very nice and easy about logging in to pockethost.io and having an instantly configured backend including email and S3, and maybe some day Litestream too. That combined with the upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/benallfree/pbscript\">PBScript</a> release and pockethost integration gives you a powerful BaaS without ever going near servers, re-compiling anything, deploying architecture-specific binaries, or needing to manage hosting provider API keys. You literally just get a pockethost URL like <a href=\"https://harvest.pockethost.io/_\">https://harvest.pockethost.io/_</a>, feed it to your client SDK, and go.</p>\n<p>@brewhousedigital generously offered to take a look at the SvelteKit UI for pockethost and might spruce it up a bit. My design skills are lacking and I'm very aware 🙈</p>\n<p>Contributions and discussion for this project at https://github.com/benallfree/pockethost</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<h1 id=\"overview\" tabindex=\"-1\">Overview <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pockethost.io/blog/0.0.1/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Unleash the alpha magic of PocketHost 0.0.1, an inventive, one-click solution that will transform how you host PocketBase projects. Let your creative web development juices flow as <a href=\"https://pockethost.io\">pockethost.io</a>, our groundbreaking product, offers compact multi-tenant hosting handled by a single Digital Ocean VPS and a whip-smart Svelte front-end. No need to tackle SSL certification and dynamic port assignment - they’re instant and automatic here.</p>\n<p>Marvel at how this lean, mean hosting machine operates. With pockethost.io, a keenly focused daemon runs on your VPS, always alert for new records from the primary pocketbase instance. Spotting one, it springs into action, provisioning an SSL cert, updating nginx, creating the data storage location, then locating a free port to give life to a new pocketbase instance solely committed to the new entry. Fear no crashes, everything automatically resurrects during startup. Keep a watchful eye on instance health, uptime, port number and more with an admin-only table.</p>\n<p>Rejoice, as each pocketbase instance claims its own subdomain. PocketHost 0.0.1 is still evolving. Future releases will offer even more, such as the ability to preconfigure pocketbase instances and more dynamic email configurations. Your feedback and suggestions will help drive which direction we head next. Edison once said, &quot;I find out what the world needs, then I proceed to invent it.&quot; Let's invent together. Join the journey now!</p>\n<p>I have an alpha up at https://pockethost.io.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running on a single Digital Ocean VPS</li>\n<li>Frontend is Svelte plus a pocketbase backend (the mothership)</li>\n<li>VPS has a daemon running that listens to new records from the main pocketbase instance. When it finds a new record, it provisions an SSL cert, updates nginx, creates a data storage location, finds a free port, and spawns a new pocketbase instance dedicated to the new entry. If anything ever crashes, this daemon will re-spawn all pocketbase instances at startup</li>\n<li>I keep an internal table (admin only) of instance info including health, uptime, port number, and other goodies</li>\n<li>Each pocketbase instance gets its own subdomain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a way to preconfigure the pocketbase instance with the correct Application URL?</li>\n<li>Is there a way to preconfigure the instance with a <code>&lt;subdomain&gt;@pockethost.io</code> email address? I have Amazon SES approved.</li>\n<li>It might make sense to shut down idle instances after 7 days or something. Waiting for a problem first.</li>\n<li>Still interested in a multitenant scenario where a single pocketbase instance can handle requests based on an <code>X-PocketBase-Tenant</code> header or something</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@ganigeorgiev Let me know what you think. Also, if the PocketHost name is too close to PocketBase please tell me and I'll change it.</p>\n",
