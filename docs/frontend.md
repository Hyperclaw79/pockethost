category: development
description: Learn how to focus purely on UI and frontend development using
  Svelte with pockethost.io. Simply clone our repository, install the needed
  packages and start a local build to connect directly to the `pockethost.io`
  mothership for seamless database tasks. No backend setup, all fun and
  function.

Just want to work with the UI and frontend?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
yarn dev:www
```

That's it. You're in business. Your local Svelte build will talk to the `pockethost.io` mothership and connect to that for all database-related tasks.
