# Maintenance Mode

Maintenance Mode will cause your PocketBase instance to shut down. The `pocketbase` process will exit and no further requests will be processed.

Maintenance Mode is helpful for the following tasks:

- Updating the version [./upgrading.md](see upgrading)
- Backing up your data [./backup-and-restore.md](see backing up and restoring)
- Emergency shutdown for any other reason you choose.

## Entering Maintenance Mode

To activate Maintenance Mode, navigate to your instance dashboard and head for the Danger Zone.
