# Overview

Relishing the thrill of frontend development without diverting focus towards backend areas is a compelling prospect. To truly immerse yourself in Svelte, `pockethost.io` makes it convenient to concentrate solely on UI and frontend tasks. An easy way to initiate this is by cloning the `pockethost.io` repository. This makes an effortless bridge for your local build to communicate with our resourceful mothership.

A quick tour through the following commands eradicates any need for backend setup. Begin by cloning the repository with `git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git`. Following that, navigate to the newly cloned directory using `cd pockethost`. The command `yarn` will install all required packages, then `yarn dev:www` starts a local build.

That's the magic. You're now in the throes of a seamless frontend undertaking. The `pockethost.io` mothership oversees your Svelte build ensuring it has resources to handle all database-related exercises. By deploying this approach, you get to relish the strengths offered by Svelte, while we shoulder the backend burden. Enjoy the freedom of crafting your UI innovations without unnecessary backend tangles.


Just want to work with the UI and frontend?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benallfree/pockethost.git
cd pockethost
yarn
yarn dev:www
```

That's it. You're in business. Your local Svelte build will talk to the `pockethost.io` mothership and connect to that for all database-related tasks.
