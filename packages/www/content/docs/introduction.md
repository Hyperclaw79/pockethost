# Overview

Starting a new project on PocketHost is as effortless as creating a project on Firebase or Supabase. Simply choose a custom subdomain and each PocketBase instance is instantly provisioned and managed on `pockethost.io`. Our cloud-hosted environment is built with speed and scalability in mind, and you can access your PocketBase instance using the PocketBase JavaScript SDK. It's as simple as `new PocketBase('https://my-project.pockethost.io')`.

We know that many web and nodejs programmers choose SvelteKit, React, Vercel, Firebase, and Supabase for their ease of use. That's why we've mirrored that simplicity with PocketHost. Set up a live PocketBase instance with no backend setup. Once you've created an account at pockethost.io, you can provision your first PocketBase instance and connect from anywhere.  

With PocketHost, you can forget about the time-consuming tasks of managing Linux/devops. We handle everything from email and DNS management to SSL certification, CDN hosting, and much more. This lets us give you more time to focus on what's really important: building your app and making an impact with your creation.
