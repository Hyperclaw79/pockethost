# Overview

You've made it here, which tells me you're ready to plunge into the exciting world of virtually effortless backend deployment, thanks to PocketHost. First off, I want to put emphasis on just how simple and swift this process is. It's almost as easy as installing a NPM package.

To kick things off, every instance of PocketHost is given its own unique subdomain. To create a new instance, you'll need to navigate to [https://app.pockethost.io/app/new](https://app.pockethost.io/app/new). This brings you to the heart of the action. Here is where you get to choose a unique name for your subdomain, which is the identifier for your PocketBase instance.

And just like that, you're in the game! Once you've nailed down your subdomain, the rest takes care of itself. Behind the scenes, PocketHost is busy threading all the virtual cables together to bring your distinct backend to life. More importantly, it's quick– almost like creating a new git branch. Awaiting you upon completion is a fresh and ready-to-go PocketBase instance, accessible via your very own, uniquely named subdomain.

So, in essence, this is backend setup without breaking a sweat, without dealing with Linux administration, Docker containers, Domain management and whatnot. It's letting PocketHost do what it's meant to do. That’s it, you’re ready to connect to your fresh instance from anywhere and start building your application. Now go out there and create something amazing!

Every PocketHost instance runs on a unique subdomain. To create a new instance, head to [https://app.pockethost.io/app/new](https://app.pockethost.io/app/new).

You'll need to choose a unique name.

That's literally all you need to do! Voila, a new PocketBase instance will now be available.
