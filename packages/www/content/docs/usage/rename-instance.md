# Overview

Accessing your PocketHost instances through their permalink, like `https://mfsicdp6ia1zpiu.pockethost.io`, is always possible. Yet, for convenience and ease of use, you can utilize a more user-friendly unique subdomain such as `https://harvest.pockethost.io`.

When it comes to renaming your applicable subdomain, tread cautiously. The renaming process releases your old name back into the pool, open for anyone to claim. This can be critical in case you decide to return to your previous moniker, or if your project has a strong connection to its original subdomain.

To maintain your digital property rights, be thoughtful about your renaming decisions. Avoid frequent name changes, especially if the subdomain name is associated with any existing functionality or references. Remember, your subdomain represents your project's digital address, making it a vital component of your brand identity. Handle it with care to prevent any undesired eventualities or reclamation by other users.

In summary, while PocketHost offers the flexibility to rename your instances, it comes with implications. Plan carefully and make sure you won't regret relinquishing your old subdomain before you decide to make a change. Your subdomain is much more than a name; it's a cornerstone of your projectâ€™s identity and accessibility.

PocketHost instances can always be accessed by their permalink, such as `https://mfsicdp6ia1zpiu.pockethost.io`, but they can also be accessed by convenient subdomain such as `https://harvest.pockethost.io`.

The subdomain name is unique across all of PocketHost, but you can change it. When you change it, you relinquish the old name and someone else can grab it if they want it. So be careful.
